This repository contains the codes used in the paper  "Single-Input Single-Output Control Strategies for Drones: a comparison between Model-Based Control and Model-Free Control".

The paper abstract:
This paper provides a comparison among different SISO (Single-Input Single-Output) control laws for Drone Position Control. The three schemes considered are a classical Phase-lead  Model-Based Control, a Model-Free Control and a Model-Free FIR control, being the last two based on ultra-local model and algebraic estimators. The simulations using Robotic Operating System (ROS), Python language and Gazebo simulator are presented and the decoupling property of Model-Free and Model-Free FIR is verified in practice. Finally, the advantages of each technique are analyzed, making the process of choosing a control law for this application clear.
